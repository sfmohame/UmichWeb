### Project Description
This project is a schedule planning website designed 
for use by University of Michigan students.  It pulls 
schedule data from the University of Michigan API 
and allows users to view classes by school, subject, 
and course number. Students can see anthything from 
the number of seats left in a class, to who the 
instructor is and what days of the week the class
meets.  The website also includes a short list of 
useful links and a map of campus to help the user
have a pleaseant scheduling experience. 

### Reach Feature
The reach feature we chose was CSS.

#### Improve User Interface Using CSS
When creating this website, we focused on
simplicity. We wanted a simple, clean-cut, 
user interface.  To do this we implemented 
the bootstrap CSS service, aling with writing
our own style in a static CSS file.
